# Notes on New DiD Methods

## _Get Estimators for DiD Designs Right_
- Can FE estimators be maintained?
  - They are fine when (i) treatment increases over time and is an absorbing state, (ii) treatment is binary, and (iii) there is no variation in adoption timing ([dCDH 2022, p.4](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3980758)).
  - Other settings would be problematic due to inappropriate weighting of (likely) heterogeneous treatment effects.
